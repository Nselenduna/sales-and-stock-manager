## 🧾 Deferred Fix Log — Sales & Stocks Manager

_These are temporarily postponed items for the sake of progress. Update, resolve, or remove as needed._

| 🔧 Item | Status | Rationale | Removal Criteria |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Duplicate Screens (`AddEditProductScreen.tsx`, `InventoryFormScreen.tsx`) | 🚨 Pending | Redundant forms; prefer InventoryFormScreen | After merge and full migration |
| Image Upload UX polish | ⏳ MVP Only | Picker working; lacks final styling | After cross-platform UI testing |
| QR Scanner error handling | ⏳ Basic Impl | Needs animations & error toasts | Once robust UX added |
| ESLint/Prettier config | ⚠️ Missing | Deferred during debug phases | When ready for codebase linting |
| Type Safety (`any` usage) | ⏳ Partial Cleanup | Needed for prototype velocity | After shared types refactor |
| Large List Optimization | ⏳ Not Applied | Small datasets for now | When user/data load grows |
| Offline Conflict Resolution | ⏳ Basic Sync Only | Queues work; merge logic absent | After multi-user logic defined |
| Jest Tests for Edge Functions | 🧪 Awaiting RPC | RPC not yet deployed/testable | Post-RPC integration |

✅ _When fixed, just delete the row — or mark with `✔️ Resolved` until full QA confirms._
