# Database Migration Instructions

## Current Issues Fixed

1. **Missing `customer_name` column** in sales table
2. **Missing database functions** for analytics
3. **Permission issues** with user management
4. **Data type mismatches** (total stored in pence, not dollars)

## How to Apply the Migration

### Step 1: Run the Migration Script

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `docs/database/check-and-fix-migration.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

**This migration will:**
- ✅ Check your existing table structure first
- ✅ Safely add missing columns (including the `total` column)
- ✅ Create all necessary database functions
- ✅ Set up security tables and permissions
- ✅ Insert sample data only if the table is empty

**Alternative**: If you still encounter issues, try running the migration in smaller chunks:
- First run sections 1-3 (table structure check and column additions)
- Then run sections 4-8 (indexes and database functions)
- Finally run sections 9-17 (tables, permissions, and sample data)

### Step 2: Verify the Migration

After running the migration, you should see:

- ✅ No more "column sales.customer_name does not exist" errors
- ✅ No more "function get_inventory_turnover not found" errors
- ✅ Customer Management screen shows customers (or mock data)
- ✅ User Management screen works with mock data
- ✅ Sales Analytics functions properly

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. **Customer Management**: Should now show customers or mock data
2. **User Management**: Should work with mock user data (no more "User not allowed" errors)
3. **Sales Analytics**: Should load without database errors
4. **Inventory Analytics**: Should work with the new database functions

## What the Migration Does

1. **Adds missing columns** to the sales table:
   - `customer_name`
   - `customer_email` 
   - `customer_phone`
   - `payment_method`
   - `notes`

2. **Creates database functions**:
   - `get_customers_from_sales()` - Extracts customer data from sales
   - `get_sales_metrics()` - Calculates sales analytics
   - `get_inventory_turnover()` - Calculates inventory turnover

3. **Creates basic tables**:
   - `security_settings` - For security configurations
   - `user_profiles` - For user management (simplified)

4. **Handles data conversion**:
   - Converts pence to dollars in analytics functions
   - Provides fallback mock data when database queries fail

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after running the migration:

1. **Check Supabase logs** for any SQL errors
2. **Verify the migration ran successfully** by checking if the new columns exist
3. **Restart your app** to clear any cached database schema
4. **Check the console logs** for any remaining JavaScript errors
