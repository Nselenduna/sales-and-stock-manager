# Database Function Error Fix

## Problem Description

The application was encountering errors when trying to call Supabase RPC functions that don't exist in the database:

```
ERROR Error fetching sales metrics: {"code": "PGRST202", "details": "Searched for the function public.get_sales_metrics with parameter start_date or with a single unnamed json/jsonb parameter, but no matches were found in the schema cache.", "hint": "Perhaps you meant to call the function public.get_sales_summary", "message": "Could not find the function public.get_sales_metrics(start_date) in the schema cache"}
```

## Root Cause

The database migration that creates the required RPC functions (`get_sales_metrics`, `get_inventory_turnover`, `get_customers_from_sales`) has not been run yet. These functions are defined in the migration files but haven't been applied to the Supabase database.

## Affected Screens

The following screens were affected by missing database functions:

1. **AdvancedAnalyticsScreen** - `get_sales_metrics`
2. **SalesForecastingScreen** - `get_inventory_turnover`
3. **InventoryAnalyticsScreen** - `get_inventory_turnover`
4. **CustomerManagementScreen** - `get_customers_from_sales` (already had fallback)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Error Handling Added

All affected screens now have proper error handling that:
- Catches database function errors gracefully
- Logs the error with helpful messages
- Falls back to mock data when functions are missing
- Continues to work without crashing

### 2. Files Modified

- `screens/analytics/AdvancedAnalyticsScreen.tsx`
- `screens/sales/SalesForecastingScreen.tsx`
- `screens/inventory/InventoryAnalyticsScreen.tsx`

### 3. Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
const { data: salesMetrics, error: salesError } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_sales_metrics', { start_date: getStartDate() });

if (salesError) {
  console.error('Error fetching sales metrics:', salesError);
  console.log('Using mock data due to missing database function. Run database migration to enable real analytics.');
  // Continue with mock data
}
```

## How to Fix Permanently

### Option 1: Run Database Migration (Recommended)

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `docs/database/check-and-fix-migration.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

This will create all the missing functions:
- `get_sales_metrics(start_date)`
- `get_inventory_turnover(start_date)`
- `get_customers_from_sales()`

### Option 2: Use Mock Data (Current State)

The application now works with mock data as a fallback. This allows development and testing to continue while the database migration is pending.

## Verification

After running the migration, you should see:
- ✅ No more "function not found" errors
- ✅ Real analytics data instead of mock data
- ✅ All screens working without database errors

## Current Status

- ✅ **Error Handling**: All screens now handle missing functions gracefully
- ✅ **Mock Data**: Application works with realistic mock data
- ✅ **No Crashes**: App continues to function even without database functions
- ⏳ **Database Migration**: Pending - needs to be run in Supabase

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** to enable real analytics
2. **Test the screens** to verify real data is loading
3. **Continue with Phase 3B** development

The application is now robust and won't crash due to missing database functions, making it ready for production use once the migration is applied.
