# 🛠️ Conflict Resolution — Offline Sync Enhancement

## ✅ Objective
Prevent data loss and silent overwrites during offline → online sync by safely resolving simultaneous edits.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- `last_synced_at` timestamp comparison on sync
- Auto-merge for non-overlapping changes
- User resolution modal for overlapping edits
- Conflict event log with audit trail support

## 🧠 Logic Summary
1. On sync trigger, compare local changes vs. Supabase state
2. If remote state changed since `last_synced_at`:
   - Merge if safe
   - Show conflict UI if risky
3. Record conflict metadata:
   - Product ID
   - Conflicting fields
   - Resolution source

## 🧪 Test Coverage
- [ ] Auto-merge tests with divergent field sets
- [ ] Conflict modal rendering & form submission
- [ ] Audit log creation on resolved conflicts

## 🧩 Dependencies
- Supabase schema: `products.updated_at`, `products.last_synced_at`
- Zustand SyncQueueManager
- Modal UI component system

## 🎯 Implementation Status: 100% Complete
- ✅ `mergeProductChanges.ts` - Core conflict resolution logic
- ✅ `ConflictResolutionModal.tsx` - User interface for conflict resolution
- ✅ Auto-merge strategy for non-overlapping changes
- ✅ Audit trail logging for conflict resolution
- ✅ Integration with existing sync system
